# What is AuthorityLite?
I is a small open-source framework for OIDC and OAuth2.0 not meant for Production.

# Who not production?
As i was in need of a small framework to test OIDC and OAuth2.0 locally, quickly, risk-free, with some good feedback in the console, i made my own little "quick-to-setup" OAuth2.0 server.

# What i planned?
The plan is to make it a small self-contained service, where most can be configured though web-interface.
The main idea is for the framework to have max debugging information, making it is for a front-end dev to understand the reason why is code is not working.
